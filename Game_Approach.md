## Snake Game Development Plan

This plan will cover everything from initial research and design to development and potential future enhancements.

### 1. Research and Innovation (Phase 1 - Ongoing)

Before diving into coding, it's crucial to understand the existing landscape and brainstorm unique elements.

*   **Objective:** Identify engaging features, common pitfalls, and innovative mechanics in existing Snake games.
*   **Process:**
    *   Play various online Snake games (classic and modern variations).
    *   Analyze their controls, scoring, difficulty progression, power-ups, and visual/audio feedback.
    *   Note down what makes them fun, frustrating, or unique.
    *   Brainstorm new ideas:
        *   **Power-ups/Power-downs:** Speed boosts, temporary invincibility, score multipliers, reverse controls, temporary shrinkage.
        *   **Special Apples:** Apples with different point values, apples that trigger events (e.g., temporarily removing obstacles).
        *   **Dynamic Environments:** Moving obstacles, changing arena shapes.
        *   **Game Modes:** Time attack, survival (last as long as possible), puzzle-based levels.
        *   **Visual Themes:** Customizable snake skins, different level aesthetics.
        *   **Social Features (Optional):** Leaderboards (beyond local score), sharing scores.
*   **Deliverable:** A document or list of "liked features," "disliked features," and "innovative ideas" to consider for your game.

### 2. Core Design and Framework (Phase 2)

This phase focuses on defining the foundational elements of the game.

*   **Technology Stack:**
    *   **HTML:** For the basic structure of the game page (canvas, scoreboard display, controls information).
    *   **CSS:** For styling the page elements, game board, snake, apples, obstacles, and UI.
    *   **JavaScript (JS):** For all game logic, including rendering, controls, collision detection, and state management.
        *   **Consider a Rendering Library/Engine (Optional but Recommended for Complexity):**
            *   **Phaser.js or PixiJS:** These 2D game engines can simplify rendering, sprite management, animations, and input handling, especially as complexity grows. For this project, starting with vanilla JS is feasible, but be prepared to refactor or integrate a library if managing the canvas rendering becomes cumbersome.
*   **Game Structure (Conceptual Framework):**
    *   **Game State Manager:** Handles the current state of the game (e.g., ` mainMenu`, `playing`, `levelUp`, `gameOver`, `paused`).
    *   **Game Loop:** The heart of the game, responsible for updating game logic and re-rendering the screen at a consistent frame rate (e.g., using `requestAnimationFrame`).
    *   **Input Handler:** Captures keyboard inputs (Arrow Keys or WASD) and translates them into snake direction changes.
    *   **Rendering Engine:** Draws all game elements (snake, apples, obstacles, score) onto the HTML canvas.
    *   **Collision Detection Module:** Checks for collisions between the snake and:
        *   Itself
        *   Walls/Boundaries
        *   Apples
        *   Bombs
    *   **Game Objects:**
        *   **Snake:**
            *   Properties: `segments` (array of x,y coordinates), `direction` (current, next), `speed`.
            *   Methods: `move()`, `grow()`, `checkSelfCollision()`, `changeDirection()`.
        *   **Apple:**
            *   Properties: `position` (x,y coordinates), `type` (if implementing special apples).
            *   Methods: `spawn()`.
        *   **Bomb/Obstacle:**
            *   Properties: `position` (x,y coordinates), `type`.
            *   Methods: `spawn()`.
        *   **Wall:**
            *   Properties: `segments` (array of x,y coordinates or defined areas).
    *   **Score Manager:** Tracks and updates the player's score.
    *   **Level Manager:** Manages level progression, apple placement, obstacle generation, and difficulty scaling.
    *   **Life Manager:** Tracks and updates player lives.
    *   **UI Manager:** Displays score, lives, level, game over messages, etc.

### 3. Application Creation Process (Phase 3 - Iterative Development)

This is where the actual coding and building happen, broken down into manageable milestones.

**Milestone 1: Basic Setup and Core Mechanics**

*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **HTML Structure:** Create `index.html` with a `<canvas>` element for the game board and placeholders for score and lives.
    2.  **CSS Styling:** Basic styling for the page and game area.
    3.  **JavaScript Setup:**
        *   Initialize the canvas and its 2D rendering context.
        *   Implement the main game loop (`requestAnimationFrame`).
        *   Create the `Snake` object:
            *   Initial position and length.
            *   Movement logic (updating segment positions based on direction).
        *   **Keyboard Controls:** Implement `InputHandler` to change the snake's direction (preventing 180-degree turns directly).
        *   **Apple Spawning:** Create an `Apple` object and a function to spawn it randomly on the game grid (ensure it doesn't spawn on the snake).
        *   **Eating Mechanism:** Detect collision between the snake's head and an apple.
        *   **Growth:** When an apple is eaten, increase the snake's length (add a new segment to its head or tail – head is usually easier).
        *   **Scoreboard:** Implement `ScoreManager` to increment and display the score when an apple is eaten.
        *   **Game Over (Basic):** Detect collision with the game boundaries. Display a simple "Game Over" message.
*   **Testing:**
    *   Snake moves correctly with keyboard input.
    *   Snake grows when it eats an apple.
    *   Score updates correctly.
    *   Game ends when hitting a boundary.

**Milestone 2: Level Design and Progression**

*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **Level Manager:**
        *   Define a data structure for levels (e.g., an array of level objects). Each object could specify:
            *   `levelNumber`
            *   `applesToClear` (e.g., 3)
            *   `snakeSpeed`
            *   `obstacles` (array of bomb positions or wall configurations)
    2.  **Apple Management:**
        *   Modify apple spawning to place exactly three apples per level.
        *   Track apples eaten within the current level.
    3.  **Wall Implementation:**
        *   Define wall segments or areas.
        *   Implement collision detection between the snake and walls.
    4.  **Bomb Implementation:**
        *   Create a `Bomb` object.
        *   Spawn bombs according to level configuration.
        *   Implement collision detection between the snake and bombs.
    5.  **Level Advancement:**
        *   When all three apples are eaten, advance to the next level.
        *   Load the new level's configuration (speed, obstacles).
        *   Reset snake position (optional, or carry over).
*   **Testing:**
    *   Correct number of apples spawn per level.
    *   Game progresses to the next level after eating all apples.
    *   Walls and bombs appear according to level design.
    *   Collision with walls and bombs is detected.

**Milestone 3: Life System**

*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **Life Manager:**
        *   Initialize player lives to 3.
        *   Display current lives on the UI.
    2.  **Losing a Life:**
        *   When the snake hits a wall or a bomb:
            *   Decrement a life.
            *   If lives > 0:
                *   Reset the snake's position (and possibly length to a minimum for the current level).
                *   Temporarily pause or show a "Get Ready" message.
            *   If lives <= 0: Trigger "Game Over."
    3.  **Gaining a Life:**
        *   When the player advances to the next level, increment a life.
*   **Testing:**
    *   Lives decrease upon hitting a wall or bomb.
    *   Game resets appropriately after losing a life (if lives remain).
    *   Game over occurs when lives reach zero.
    *   A life is added upon advancing to a new level.

**Milestone 4: Complexity Scaling and Refinements**

*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **Difficulty Curve:**
        *   Gradually increase snake speed with each level or after a certain number of points.
        *   Increase the number or complexity of obstacles (e.g., more bombs, more intricate wall patterns) in higher levels.
        *   Ensure the "three apples per level" rule is maintained while increasing other challenges.
    2.  **Self-Collision:** Implement collision detection for the snake hitting its own body. This should also result in losing a life or game over (depending on your design choice – typically losing a life).
    3.  **UI Enhancements:**
        *   Clear display of current level.
        *   Game over screen with final score and options (e.g., "Play Again").
        *   Start screen/Main menu.
        *   Pause functionality.
*   **Testing:**
    *   Game difficulty noticeably increases with levels.
    *   Self-collision is detected and handled correctly.
    *   UI elements are clear and functional.

**Milestone 5: Incorporating Research and Innovative Aspects**

*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **Review Research:** Revisit the "innovative ideas" list from Phase 1.
    2.  **Select and Implement:** Choose 1-2 innovative features that fit well with the core game and are feasible to implement. Examples:
        *   **Power-up:** A special apple that appears occasionally and grants a temporary speed boost or makes the snake shorter.
        *   **Moving Obstacle:** A simple obstacle that moves horizontally or vertically.
        *   **Bonus Points:** Award bonus points for eating apples quickly or clearing a level without losing a life.
    3.  **Sound Effects/Music (Optional but Recommended):**
        *   Add simple sound effects for eating apples, collisions, level up, and game over.
        *   Background music (royalty-free).
*   **Testing:**
    *   New features work as intended and enhance gameplay.
    *   Sound effects and music (if added) play correctly and improve the experience.

**Milestone 6: Final Polish and Deployment**

*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **Bug Fixing:** Thoroughly test the game across different scenarios and fix any identified bugs.
    2.  **Code Refactoring:** Clean up the code, make it more readable and maintainable. Add comments where necessary.
    3.  **Cross-Browser Testing (Basic):** Ensure the game works reasonably well on major modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
    4.  **Performance Optimization:** Check for any performance bottlenecks, especially with rendering or collision detection in later levels.
    5.  **Deployment:** Host the game on a platform like GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or your own web server.
*   **Testing:**
    *   Game is stable and performs well.
    *   No major bugs are present.
    *   Game is accessible and playable online.

### 4. Additional Aspects & Enhancements (Post-MVP)

Once the core game with the requested features is complete, consider these:

*   **Advanced Visuals:**
    *   Smoother animations for snake movement.
    *   Different themes or skins for the snake and game board.
    *   Particle effects (e.g., when eating an apple or hitting a bomb).
*   **More Complex Levels/Obstacles:**
    *   Levels with unique shapes or boundaries.
    *   Obstacles that react to the snake's presence.
*   **AI Opponent (Ambitious):** A computer-controlled snake.
*   **Mobile Controls:** Implement touch controls for mobile playability (swipe gestures).
*   **Persistent High Scores:** Use `localStorage` to save high scores locally, or a backend service for global leaderboards.
*   **Accessibility Features:** Consider options for colorblind players, adjustable speed, etc.

### Key Considerations Throughout Development:

*   **Modularity:** Write code in well-defined functions and objects/classes to keep it organized and easier to debug/extend.
*   **Version Control:** Use Git and GitHub (or similar) from the beginning to track changes and collaborate if needed.
*   **Iterative Testing:** Test frequently after implementing small pieces of functionality. Don't wait until the end to find major issues.
*   **User Feedback:** If possible, get others to playtest your game at various stages and provide feedback.
*   **Keep it Fun:** Remember the goal is to create an engaging game. If a feature feels tedious to implement or doesn't add to the fun, reconsider its priority.
